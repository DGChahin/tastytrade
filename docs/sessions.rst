Sessions
========

Creating an OAuth application
-----------------------------

A session object is required to authenticate your requests to the Tastytrade API. Tastytrade uses OAuth logins, which allow you to connect applications (third-party or private) to your trading account to use the API.

To get started, create a new OAuth application `here <https://my.tastytrade.com/app.html#/manage/api-access/oauth-applications>`_. Check all the scopes you plan to use, add `http://localhost:8000` as a valid callback, and create the application. **Save the client secret**, you'll need it later!

Generating an initial refresh token
-----------------------------------

In order to generate an initial refresh token, you have two options. The easiest way is to simply generate one from Tastytrade's website: go to OAuth Applications > Manage > Create Grant to get a new refresh token, **which you should also save**.

The other option (which is actually the only option for sandbox accounts) is to run this helper code:

.. code-block:: python

   from tastytrade.oauth import login
   login(is_test=True)

This will open up a web interface in your browser where you'll be prompted to paste your client ID and client secret. These credentials will then be used to connect your application to Tastytrade. After following the steps in your browser, you should see your new refresh token in the browser and in the console.

At this point, OAuth is now setup correctly! Doing these steps once is sufficient for **indefinite usage** of ``Session`` for authentication to the API, since refresh tokens never expire. From now on you can simply authenticate with your client secret and refresh token.

Creating a session
------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from tastytrade import Session

   session = Session('client_secret', 'refresh_token')

These session objects can be used to make API requests:

.. code-block:: python

   from tastytrade import Account

   accounts = Account.get(session)

Note that OAuth sessions make API requests using a special session token, which has a duration of only 15 minutes. However, since the refresh tokens last forever, you can call ``Session.refresh()`` to refresh the session token whenever needed. The session object will keep track of session expiration time for you to make it easier to know when to refresh:

.. code-block:: python

   from tastytrade.utils import now_in_new_york

   if now_in_new_york() > session.session_expiration:
       session.refresh()
       print(Account.get(session))

A sandbox account for testing can be created `here <https://developer.tastytrade.com/sandbox/>`_, then used to create a session in the same way:

.. code-block:: python

   from tastytrade import Session
   session = Session('client_secret', 'refresh_token', is_test=True)
